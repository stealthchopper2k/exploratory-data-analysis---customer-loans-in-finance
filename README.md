# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance

This project aims to perform EDA on loan portfolio and use statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in loan data. We also prepare the data for ML algorithms by fixing impact of outliers and data skewness. Furthermore visualise the future payments and attempt to correlate parameters of user data to failing loan payments

This is with the purpose of enabling the business to make more informed decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.
